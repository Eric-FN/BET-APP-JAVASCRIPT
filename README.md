📝 Dice Betting Game

This project is a simple betting game where the player starts with 50 coins and can bet on numbers from 1 to 6. In each round, a random number is drawn. If the chosen number matches the drawn number, the player wins double the bet amount; otherwise, they lose the bet. The game ends when the player reaches 100 or more coins or runs out of coins.

🛠 Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS (with custom properties and Google Fonts)
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, Event Handling, Game Logic)
- Google Fonts (Open Sans)

📁 Project Structure:

- **index.html**: Page structure, including the betting form and current coin balance display.
- **css/style.css**: Custom styles for the game, including responsive design, fonts, and button effects.
- **js/main.js**: Core game logic:
  - Draws a random number between 1 and 6.
  - Compares the drawn number with the bet number.
  - Updates the player's balance based on the result.
